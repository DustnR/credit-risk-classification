# credit-risk-classification

The purpose of this model is to help sort out loan risk in regards to mupltiple different factors such as loan size, interest rate, borrower income, debit to income, number of accounts, derogatory marks, and total debt. 

The first model proformed well with a balanced accuracy score of 94%. And a weighter average of 99%. 

The second model proformed much better using the oversampled data. It had a balanced accuracy score of 99% with a perfect weighter average score.

I would definitely recommend the use of the logistic regression model with the oversampled data. It is very accurate.
